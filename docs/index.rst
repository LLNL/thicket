Thicket is a python-based toolkit for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of parallel
performance data that enables performance optimization and understanding of
applications' performance on supercomputers. It bridges the performance tool gap between
being able to consider only a single instance of a simulation run (e.g., single
platform, single measurement tool, or single scale) and finding actionable insights in
multi-dimensional, multi-scale, multi-architecture, and multi-tool performance datasets.

You can get thicket from its `GitHub repository <https://github.com/llnl/thicket>`_:

.. code:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/llnl/thicket.git

or install it using pip:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install llnl-thicket
